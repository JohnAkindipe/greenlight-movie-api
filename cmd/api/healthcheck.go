The important thing to point out here is that healthcheckHandler is implemented as a method on our application struct.
This is an effective and idiomatic way to make dependencies available to our handlers without resorting to
global variables or closures â€” any dependency that the healthcheckHandler needs can simply be included as a field
in the application struct when we initialize it in main().
