1 CLOSE CONNECTION MANUALLY
Panic would usually unwind the entire goroutine stack, call
deferred functions along the way, close the underlying http connection (without sending a message),
print the stack trace and log the error message. However, the documentatino states that if we recover
a panic in a deferred function (as we are doing in this case), the panicking sequence stops, therefore
the onus is on us to manually take over what the panicking sequence will normally do. Hence, we
- Close the http connection
- log the error and
- Send an error response (the panicking sequence wouldn't normally do this, however, we can
since we have taken over the panicking sequence) using our custom serverErrorResponse helper

2 PANIC RECOVERY IN OTHER GOROUTINES
It’s really important to realize that our middleware will only recover panics that happen 
in the same goroutine that executed the recoverPanic() middleware.

If, for example, you have a handler which spins up another goroutine (e.g. to do some background 
processing), then any panics that happen in the background goroutine will not be recovered — not 
by the recoverPanic() middleware… and not by the panic recovery built into http.Server. These 
panics will cause your application to exit and bring down the server.

So, if you are spinning up additional goroutines from within your handlers and there is any chance 
of a panic, you must make sure that you recover any panics from within those goroutines too.

3. RATE LIMITING USING THE PATTERN DESIGNED ABOVE
Using this pattern for rate-limiting will only work if your API application is running on a 
single-machine. If your infrastructure is distributed, with your application running on multiple 
servers behind a load balancer, then you’ll need to use an alternative approach.

If you’re using HAProxy or Nginx as a load balancer or reverse proxy, both of these have built-in 
functionality for rate limiting that it would probably be sensible to use. Alternatively, you 
could use a fast database like Redis to maintain a request count for clients, running on a server 
which all your application servers can communicate with.

4 VARY RESPONSE HEADER
If your code makes a decision about what to return based on the content of a request header, you 
should include that header name in your Vary response header — even if the request didn’t include 
that header. This is important for CACHES and prevents subtle bugs like as described below
https://textslashplain.com/2018/08/02/cors-and-vary/s

5. IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO PREFLIGHT REQUESTS
A browser will send a preflight request when it determines that the real request it wants to make
is not a simple CORS request.
Preflight requests always have three components: the HTTP method OPTIONS, an Origin header, and an 
Access-Control-Request-Method header. If any one of these pieces is missing, we know that it is not 
a preflight request.

Once we identify that it is a preflight request, we need to send a 200 OK response with some special 
headers to let the browser know whether or not it’s OK for the real request to proceed. These are:
- An Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, which reflects the value of the preflight request’s 
Origin header (just like in the previous chapter).
- An Access-Control-Allow-Methods header listing the HTTP methods that can be used in real cross-origin 
requests to the URL.
- An Access-Control-Allow-Headers header listing the request headers that can be included in real 
cross-origin requests to the URL.

When responding to a preflight request it’s not necessary to include the CORS-safe methods HEAD, GET or 
POST in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header. Likewise, it’s not necessary to include forbidden or 
CORS-safe headers in Access-Control-Allow-Headers.

6. MIDDLEWARE UP THE CALL STACK
When we call the next.ServeHTTP() inside the middleware, it will call the next middleware, when that
middleware returns, we increase the responses sent variable (at this point we know we have successfully
sent a response, hence why we can't use a defer - a defer would increment the response sent, whether or
not we send a response. The author doesn't do this, but I believe we should increase the 
totalProcessingTime in a defer because, we want to increase it whether or not we were able to send a 
response successfully or not). Another clever thing we do is to initialize the variables before we return
the main body of the middleware; this is important because go serves every request in a new goroutine.
If we initialize the variable inside the main middleware body, it will initialize a different variable for
every request, but by doing it as we have currently done (outside the returned middleware), the variables 
will be global for the application and every request (in another goroutine) will be referencing the same
global variables and making changes to the variables.

OTHER USEFUL METRICS:
- The number of ‘active’ in-flight requests:
total_requests_received - total_responses_sent
- The average number of requests received per second (between calls A and B to the GET /debug/vars endpoint):
(total_requests_received_B - total_requests_received_A) / (timestamp_B - timestamp_A)
- The average processing time per request (between calls A and B to the GET /debug/vars endpoint):
(total_processing_time_μs_B - total_processing_time_μs_A) / (total_requests_received_B - total_requests_received_A)
*/
