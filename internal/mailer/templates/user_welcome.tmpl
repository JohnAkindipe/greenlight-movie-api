Inside this file we’re going to define three named templates to use as part of our welcome email:

A "subject" template containing the subject line for the email.
A "plainBody" template containing the plain-text variant of the email message body.
A "htmlBody" template containing the HTML variant of the email message body.

{{define "subject"}}Welcome to Greenlight!{{end}}

{{define "plainBody"}}
Hi,

Thanks for signing up for a Greenlight account. We're excited to have you on board!

For future reference, your user ID number is {{.userID}}.

Please send a request to the `PUT /v1/users/activated` endpoint with the following JSON
body to activate your account:

{"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}

Please note that this is a one-time use token and it will expire in 3 days.

Thanks,

The Greenlight Team

NOTE ON STORING TEMPLATES IN DB FOR USER-EDITABLE TEMPLATES
Note: If you need to frequently change the text of emails or require them to be user-editable, then it might be 
appropriate to store these templates as strings in your database instead. But I’ve found that storing them in a file, 
like we are here, is a less complicated approach and a good starting point for most projects.
